# **SIA Updater**

## üß≠ Overview  
**SIA Updater** is a Windows application built in **C#** and **SQL Server** using **Visual Studio**, designed to automatically monitor and process updates to the **SIA system** by syncing contract-related data extracted from SAP TXT files.  

It runs as a background service, regularly scanning a designated folder for new files and executing the parsing and database update logic without user interaction.

---

## üí° Idea & Concept  
To eliminate manual intervention and ensure that **SIA modules**‚Äîincluding **Warehouse**, **Petty Cash**, and **Material Testing**‚Äîalways operate with up-to-date contract information, this utility was developed to automate data import from SAP TXT files.

---

## ‚ú® Features & Functionality  
- **Background Sync Engine:** Monitors folders for new TXT files  
- **Data Parser:** Reads, validates, and formats SAP TXT data  
- **Auto Contract Sync:** Creates or updates contract entries in the SIA database  
- **Silent Execution:** Runs with minimal footprint, invisible to most users  
- **Execution Log:** Tracks updates, errors, skipped files, and update timestamps  
- **Always-On Design:** Runs at intervals or continuously depending on configuration  
- **Multi-threaded Handling:** Optimized for file scanning and DB writes

## üèó Architecture & Design  
- File system watcher monitors designated directory  
- TXT parser extracts structured data  
- SQL commands handle upserts into `Contracts` and related tables  
- Logs execution to a dedicated table for audits  
- Configurable schedule via Windows Task Scheduler or app settings  

---

## üöÄ Installation & Setup  
**Prerequisites:**  
- Windows OS  
- .NET Framework  
- SQL Server with access to SIA DB  
- Folder with SAP TXT export feed  

**Setup Steps:**  
1. Configure folder path and DB credentials  
2. Schedule using Task Scheduler or set up as a Windows Service  
3. Monitor logs in the DB or log file
